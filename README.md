# Dynamic Weighted Trie Tree: Comprehensive Implementation Guide

## Introduction

The Dynamic Weighted Trie Tree is an advanced data structure optimized for the efficient storage and retrieval of strings. It dynamically adjusts its structure based on usage patterns to maintain optimal performance. This comprehensive guide provides detailed information about the implementation, functionalities, and usage of the Dynamic Weighted Trie Tree.

## Component Overview

### TrieNode Class

**Attributes:**
- `Children`: Map of characters to TrieNode pointers, representing subsequent characters in inserted strings.
- `Shortcut`: Optional faster access path to a frequently accessed node.
- `EndOfWord`: Boolean indicating if the node marks the end of an inserted word.
- `Weight`: Integer representing the node's access frequency.
- `LastAccessTime`: Timestamp of the last access for the node.

### Trie Class

**Attributes:**
- `Root`: The root node of the Trie Tree.
- `OperationCount`: Tracks the number of operations to determine rebalancing times.
- `RebalanceThreshold`: The threshold for triggering a rebalance.
- `DecayFactor`: The rate at which the weight of nodes decays over time.

## Key Functionalities

### Insertion
`void insert(const string& word)`: Adds a new word to the Trie, updating node weights and triggering a rebalance if necessary.

### Search
`bool search(const string& word)`: Searches for a word, returning true if found.

### Weight Decay
`void applyWeightDecay()`: Reduces node weights over time, reflecting diminished usage.

### Path Optimization
`void optimizePaths(int currentTime)`: Creates shortcuts to frequently accessed nodes to enhance search efficiency.

## Auxiliary Methods

Detailed descriptions of private methods like `rebalance()`, `flattenTrie()`, `clearTrie()`, `decayWeights()`, and various optimization utilities.

## Usage Example

A step-by-step guide demonstrating the Trie's instantiation, insertion of strings, application of weight decay, and path optimization. Includes expected outputs and explanations.

## Compiling and Execution

Detailed instructions for compiling with C++11 (or later) compilers and executing the program. Includes system requirements and dependency management.

## Configuration and Customization

Guidelines for adjusting `RebalanceThreshold` and `DecayFactor` to suit different usage scenarios and performance goals.

## Memory Management

In-depth discussion on the strategies implemented to ensure efficient memory use and prevent leaks, especially during dynamic operations.

## Performance Considerations

Analysis of the Trie's performance characteristics, including time complexity, space usage, and scenarios where the structure is particularly advantageous.

## Testing and Validation

Description of the testing framework used, test cases, and instructions for running tests to validate the Trie's functionality and performance.

## Contributing
